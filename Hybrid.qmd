## Hybrid 4-State Model: DTMC and CTMC

## Step 1: Estimate DTMC Transition Matrix from the State Table
This is standard practice if your state table contains counts of transitions between states: The empirical DTMC matrix 𝑃can be estimated by normalizing row-wise transition counts.This assumes you’re sampling transitions at fixed discrete intervals or observing transitions without timing.

### Limitation:
DTMC ignores sojourn times, which are critical in CTMCs. If the time intervals vary or aren’t known, this step risks losing temporal resolution.


## Step 2: Estimate Expected Time Spent (Sojourn Time) in Each State
You propose using the number of visits to each state as a proxy:

If you know total observation time and the number of visits per state, you could estimate average duration per visit: $$ \text{Expected time in state } i \approx \frac{\text{Total time in } i}{\text{Number of visits to } i} $$





### Limitation: This assumes homogeneous sojourn times across visits, which might not hold if transitions are history-dependent or rates vary.


## Step 3: Estimate CTMC Generator Matrix from DTMC and Expected Times
This is where things get tricky. The generator matrix 𝑄 relates to the DTMC matrix 
𝑃 via: $$ Q = \frac{P - I}{\Delta t} $$ when 𝑃is derived from a uniform discrete time step Δ𝑡. But in
this case we need to reconstruct 𝑄via $$ Q_{ij} \approx \frac{P_{ij}}{E[\text{sojourn time in state } i]}

$$

Diagonal elements then follow: $$ Q_{ii} = - \sum_{j \neq i} Q_{ij} $$


## Risk: 
This method assumes exponentially distributed sojourn times (i.e. memoryless transitions) and accurat estimation of both 𝑃 and expected dwell times. Aggregated data may obscure these subtleties.


## Assessment 
Your approach is viable if:

* The state table contains detailed counts of transitions (ideally with timestamps or time spent).
* Sojourn time estimates are reasonably accurate.
* The assumptions of the CTMC (exponential transitions, time-homogeneity) roughly hold.
* It might be better to treat it as purely discrete and fit a DTMC model, or consider an EM algorithm to infer rates under partial observability.



```{r}
# Example: 4x4 count matrix
state_counts <- matrix(c(310,70,2,0,
                   96, 1683, 11, 13,
                   1, 11, 1, 0,
                   0, 0, 0, 94), nrow=4, byrow=TRUE)

# Normalize row-wise to get DTMC transition probabilities
P_dtmc <- prop.table(state_counts, margin = 1)

# Hypothetical expected dwell times (replace with actual estimates)
expected_sojourn <- c(5.0, 4.2, 3.8, 6.0)  # time spent per visit, per state
